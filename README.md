# Cross-Platform Integration in Kidney Transplant Rejection

A Quarto-based analysis examining compartment-specific immune targeting strategies in kidney transplant rejection.

## About

This project analyzes cross-platform integration data to reveal immune targeting strategies specific to different compartments in kidney transplant rejection. The analysis combines multiple data sources to provide insights into transplant immunology.

## Files

- `analysis.qmd` - Main Quarto document with analysis code and narrative
- `data/` - Dataset files (if applicable)
- `figures/` - Generated plots and visualizations
- `analysis.html` - Rendered HTML output

## Requirements

To run this analysis, you'll need:

- R (version 4.0+)
- Quarto
- Required R packages:
  - tidyverse
  - ggplot2
  - [add other packages you use]

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `analysis.qmd` in RStudio or your preferred editor
3. Install required packages if needed
4. Render the document:
   ```
   quarto render analysis.qmd
   ```

## Output

The analysis generates:
- HTML report with interactive visualizations
- Statistical summaries of immune response patterns
- Compartment-specific targeting strategy recommendations
